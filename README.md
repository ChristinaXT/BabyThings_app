The Baby Things List Organizer is meant for new or expecting moms and dads to be able to create a list of baby needs. You can list clothing items that you need or want for your little one, but feel free to also add baby accessories, food items and furniture as well.  Edit the list as many times as you want to keep your ideas fresh and up-to-date.

Clone this repository https://github.com/ChristinaXT/BabyThings_app.git

Run bundle install
Run shotgun
and visit the local host to begin your baby list experience.
