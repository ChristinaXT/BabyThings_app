I am thinking of creating an app that allows users to organize baby needs. I have a six month old little boy and I can personally attest to the fact that organizing clothing, toys, books, feeding essentials, bath and body products, diapers, wipes, and more is exhausting and overwhelming. Knowing what you may need by how old baby is, what you can utilize for a long time, what you can swap out and what you would like to keep for either keepsakes or perhaps to pass down to another future sibling or cousin can be helpful. 

Ideas 
1) what do you need by age?
2) what should you keep each month and what can you sell or give away?
3) items for huge milestones?
4) share baby pics?

Design the app with css (bootstrap?) with cute baby themed images and colors

App will have a sign up, login and logout for users to create their own organization page and ideas. 
Users will be able to edit and delete items off of their own organization page. 

Is it possible to include a guidelines page with ideas from own experience?
